# electromagnetCabinet
It's all the code for my electromagnetic cabinet, apart from a few unimportant details

Note: The photoRecognition.py file was just a test for me to try out the face recognition algorithims. I just added it there for fun. Enjoy!!! I have also added some notes to further explain the code

# electromagnetCabinet
It's all the code for my electromagnetic cabinet, apart from a few unimportant details

Note: The photoRecognition.py file was just a test for me to try out the face recognition algorithims. I just added it there for fun. Enjoy!!! I have also added some notes to further explain the code

Note again: The file live.py is for the computer version of the code, NOT the raspberry pi. I think it can run on a pi, but would be too slow. I will have to test this, once I get this script fully working.

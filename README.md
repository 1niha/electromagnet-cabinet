# electromagnetCabinet
It's all the code for my electromagnetic cabinet, apart from a few unimportant details

Note: The photoRecognition.py file was just a test for me to try out the face recognition algorithims. I just added it there for fun. Enjoy!!! I have also added some notes to further explain the code

Note again: The file live.py is for the computer version of the code and the pi version,  

The live.py file completely works for the computer version and by my estimates runs at about 1 or 2 fps with the 'hog' model. However, with the 'cnn' model, it's a completely different story and runs at rougly 0.01fps, on the pi. 
Read the notes in the files to see how it works and to see what it does

Big thanks to this article, which helped me write some of the functions:

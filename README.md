# electromagnetCabinet
It's all the code for my electromagnetic cabinet, apart from a few unimportant details

Note: The photoRecognition.py file was just a test for me to try out the face recognition algorithims. I just added it there for fun. Enjoy!!! I have also added some notes to further explain the code

Note again: The file live.py is for the computer version of the code, NOT the raspberry pi. I think it can run on a pi, but would be too slow. I will have to test this, once I get this script fully working. 

The live.py file completely works for the computer version and by my estimates runs at about 1 or 2 fps with the 'hog' model. However, with the 'cnn' model, it's a completely different story and runs at rougly 0.01fps. 
Read the notes in the files to see how it works and to see what it does
